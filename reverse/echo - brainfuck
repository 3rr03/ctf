# Echo - brainfuck

## Intro
This Challenge is about reversing a Executable. Analyzing the Code on the fly shows,
that a functions generates https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck Code. While analyzing
one can see the flag{}. But the Brainfuck Code has a sequence at the end `>[+]` which shift's 
it out. So only "0" appear. Replacing `>[+]` with `>>>>>` and reexecution gves the flag.
